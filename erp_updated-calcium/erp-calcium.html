<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>In order to understand the workflow and initial parameter sets provided with this tutorial, we must first briefly describe prior studies that led to the creation of the provided data and evoked response parameter set that you will work with. This tutorial is based on results from our 2007 study where we recorded and simulated tactile evoked responses source localized to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) [1].</p>
<p>In our 2007 study, we investigated the early evoked activity (0-175 ms) elicited by a brief tap to the D3 digit and source localized to an an equivalent current dipole in the contralateral hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) [1]. The strength of the tap was set at either suprathreshold (100% detection probability) or perceptual threshold (50% detection) levels (see Figure 1, left panel below). Note, to be precise, this data represents source localized event related field (ERF) activity because it was collected using MEG. We use the terminology ERP for simplicity, since the primary current dipoles generating evoked fields and potentials are the same.</p>
<p>We found that we could reproduce evoked responses that accurately reflected the recorded waveform in our neocortical model from a layer specific sequence of exogenous excitatory synaptic drive to the local SI circuit, see Figure 1right panel below. This drive consisted of “feedforward” / proximal input at ~25 ms post-stimulus, followed by “feedback” / distal input at ~60 ms, followed by a subsequent “feedforward” / proximal input at ~125 ms (Gaussian distribution of input times on each simulated trial). This sequence of drive generated spiking activity and intracellular dendritic current flow in the pyramidal neuron dendrites to reproduce the current dipole signal. This sequence of drive can be interpreted as initial “feedforward” input from the lemniscal thalamus, followed by “feedback” input from higher order cortex or non-lemniscal thalamus, followed by a re-emergent leminsical thalamic drive. Intracranial recordings in non-human primates motivated and supported this assumption [2].</p>
<p>In our model, the exogenous driving inputs were simulated as predefined trains of action potentials (pre-synaptic spikes) that activated excitatory synapses in the local cortical circuit in proximal and distal projection patterns (i.e. feedforward, and feedback, respectively, as shown schematically in Figure 1 right, and in the HNN GUI Model Schematics). The number, timing and strength (post-synaptic conductance) of the driving spikes were manually adjusted in the model until a close representation of the data was found (all other model parameters were tuned and fixed based on the morphology, physiology and connectivity within layered neocortical circuits [1]. Note, a scaling factor was applied to net dipole output to match to the magnitude of the recorded ERP data and used to predict the number of neurons contributing to the recorded ERP (purple circle, Figure 1, right panel). The dipole units were in nAm, with a one-to-one comparison between data and model output due to the biophysical detail in our model.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>In summary, to simulate the SI evoked response, a sequence of exogenous excitatory synaptic drive was simulated (by creating presynaptic spikes that activate layer specific synapses in the neocortical network) consisting of proximal drive at ~25 ms, followed by distal drive at ~60 ms, followed by a second proximal drive at ~122 ms. Given this background information, we can now walk you through the steps of simulating a similar ERP, using a subset of the data shown in Figure 1.</p>

<h2 id="loadview-data">1. Load/view data</h2>
<p>Example ERP data is provided with the HNN installation, as an orienting example for where to begin to simulate an ERP. This data represents early evoked activity (0-175 ms) from an equivalent current dipole source localized to the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), elicited by a brief perceptual threshold level tap to the contralateral D3 digit (read Getting Started above for details). The example dataset provided was collected at 600Hz and contains only averaged data from 100 trials in which the tap was detected. (Note, when loading your own data, if it was not collected at 600Hz, you must first downsample to 600Hz to view it in the HNN GUI).</p>
<p>To load and view this data, navigate to the main GUI window and click:</p>
<pre><code>File menu &gt; Load data file</code></pre>
<p>Select data/MEG_detection_data/yes_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg.txt (note that the data are in a subdirectory under the main HNN install location; you can also press Control-D to load a data file). HNN will then load the data and display the waveform in the dipole window as shown below.</p>

<p>Note, the software can be used without loading data. If you wish to play with simulations without data, proceed to Step 2 first.</p>
<p><a id="toc_2"></a></p>
<h2 id="loadview-parameters-to-define-network-structure-to-activate-the-network">2. Load/view parameters to define network structure &amp; to “activate” the network</h2>
<p>An initial parameter set that will simulate an evoked response in close agreement with the SI data described in Step 1 can be downloaded using the following hyperlink: <a href="https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn/blob/master/param/ERPYes100Trials.param">ERPYes100Trials.param</a>. The file can also be found in HNN’s param subfolder. At the top of the HNN GUI, click Set Parameters From File and select the file ‘ERPYes100Trials.param’ from HNN’s param subfolder or from your local machine.</p>
<p>The template cortical column networks structure for this simulation is described in the Overview and What’s Under the Hood sections. Several of the network parameter can be adjusted via the HNN GUI (e.g. local excitatory and inhibitory connection strengths), but we will leave them fixed for this tutorial and only adjust the inputs that “activate” the network.</p>
<p>To view the parameters that “activate” the network in a manner that will generate an evoked response, navigate to the main HNN GUI and click:</p>
<pre><code>Set Parameters &gt; Evoked Inputs</code></pre>
<p>This will bring up the Evoked Inputs dialog box, as seen below. It is important to first read the “Getting Started” section of this tutorial to understand the various components and parameter values in this dialog box.</p>
<p>As described in the “Getting Started” section, the evoked response can be simulated with a sequence of exogenous driving inputs consisting of a proximal input at ~26 ms (Proximal 1), followed by a distal input at ~64 ms (Distal 1), followed by a subsequent proximal input at ~137 ms (Proximal 2). There are three tabs in the “Evoked Inputs” dialog box detailing the parameters for each of these driving inputs. Note, by clicking the Add Proximal Inputor Add Distal Inputbuttons, any number of additional proximal/distal inputs can be added to your simulation for your hypothesis testing goals. The Remove Input button will remove an input.</p>
<p>Each evoked input consists of a Gaussian distributed train of presynaptic action potentials, with several adjustable parameters, including the number of the driving spikes on each trial of the simulation, the mean start time and standard deviation of each spike (ms), and the postsynaptic conductance of the drive defined by the postsynaptic cell (e.g., L2Pyr = Layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron). Note that the Synchronous Inputscheckbox allows specification of whether each cell/synapse receives inputs at the same time or whether each cell/synapse receive inputs independently. In either case, the synaptic input times are drawn from the same distribution. Schematic representations of the postsynaptic location of each input is shown in the dialog box. For further details on the connectivity structure of the network, see the Under the Hood section of the HNN webpage.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-simulation-and-visualizing-net-current-dipole">3. Running the simulation and visualizing net current dipole</h2>
<p>Now that we have an initial parameter set, we can run a series of simulations (100 trials) that will produce the output shown below.</p>
<p>On each simulated trial, the timings of the evoked inputs (i.e., spikes) are chosen from a Gaussian distribution with mean and stdev (standard deviation) as defined in the “Evoked Inputs” dialog boxes. Histograms of each of the evoked inputs will be displayed at the top of the HNN GUI.</p>
<p>In the figure below, the thin gray traces are dipole signals from individual trials while the thick black trace is the average ERP, with histograms of the proximal (red, evprox) and distal (green, evdist) driving spikes shown above. Arrows indicate the mean timing of the proximal and distal drive, and the directionality roughly describes the direction of the driven primary dipole currents. This figure also shows MEG data (red; loaded in Step 1) and the root-mean-squared-error comparison between data and model.</p>
<p>You can remove the data from the figure by selecting</p>
<pre><code>File &gt; Clear Data File</code></pre>
<p>You can also clear the data from the figure by pressing Control-C).</p>

</div>
<p>To run this simulation, we’ll first change the simulation name (i.e., the name under which the simulated data will be saved), and reduce the number of trials for a faster simulation. In the “Set Parameters” dialog box, enter a new descriptivename for the simulation here; for example, ERPYes2Trials, as shown below.</p>

</div>
<p>Next, press the Run button in the “Set Parameters” dialog box, and a “Run Parameters” dialog box will open, with several adjustable parameters, as shown below. These parameters control the duration, integration time step, number of trials, and number of computer processing cores to run the simulation with. Note: NumCores is the number of cores to parallelize the model, is automatically detected by HNN and may differ, depending on your hardware. For a faster simulation, change the number of trials from 100 to 2.</p>

</div>
<p>Next, navigate to the main HNN GUI window, shown above, and press the Run Simulation. This will start the simulation, which should take 1-2 minutes depending on your hardware.</p>
<div class="stylefig">
<h3 id="figure-7">Figure 7</h3>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image28.png"><img class="imgcenter100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image28.png" alt="image28" style="max-width:500px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<p>The above figure shows model output in a white window in the HNN GUI after running 2 trials. Here, the experimental data was removed from the window; to do this, navigate to the main GUI and select:</p>
<pre><code>File &gt; Clear data file</code></pre>
<p>The top two panels of the model output show histograms of input times from distal evoked inputs in green (evdist) and proximal evoked inputs in red (evprox). The bottom panel shows the simulated dipole signals. The gray traces are from individual trials while the black trace is the average across trials.</p>
<p>Importantly, note that a scaling factor of 3000.00 was multiplied by the net dipole produced by the model, as seen on the y-axis scale. This scaling factor can be adjusted to match the magnitude of the recorded data; the value of 3000 is the default value for the loaded parameterset. To change this scaling factor, click on the Runbutton on the main parameter dialog. Then click on the “Analysis” tab and enter the desired scaling factor in the “Dipole Scaling” text box, as shown below.</p>
<div class="stylefig">
<h3 id="figure-8">Figure 8</h3>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image6.png"><img class="imgcenter100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image6.png" alt="image6" style="max-width:300px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<p>In this case, since the template model contains 200 pyramidal neurons (PNs), the simulation predicts that the number of cells that contribute to the signal is 600,000 (200 x 3000) PNs.</p>
<p>Also note that in the ERP simulation shown, the raw dipole signal was smoothed using a Hamming filter using a window size of 30 milliseconds, in order to reduce noise in the ERP signal generated by this reduced network model. The level of smoothing can be changed through setting the value in the parameters by setting the Dipole Smooth Window (ms) in the Run/Analysis dialog box shown above.</p>
<p>The longer the smoothing window, the more smoothing will occur. To turn off smoothing entirely, set the window size to 0. Below, we provide an example of the same simulation with smoothing turned off entirely. Note the higher-frequency content compared to the ERP simulation with smoothing turned on.</p>
<p>Also note that before running this simulation, we removed the prior simulation by pressing the “Remove Simulation” button at the bottom of the GUI while it was selected. Had we not done so, both simulation dipoles would be displayed (old simulation with dotted line, new simulation with solid line; see “Tour of the GUI” for more details on simulation control). In the remainder of the tutorial, before running a new simulation, we always remove the previously run simulation.</p>

<h2 id="a-closer-look-inside-the-simulations-contribution-of-layers-and-cell-types">4. A closer look inside the simulations: contribution of layers and cell types</h2>
<p>One of the main advantages of simulating neocortical activity is that we can dive into the details of the simulation to investigate the contribution of different components in the network; e.g., layers, cell types, etc. HNN currently enables the viewing of the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>layer specific dipole activity</p></li>
<li><p>spiking activity in each individual neuron population</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="viewing-layer-specific-current-dipoles">4.1 Viewing layer specific current dipoles</h3>
<p>From the main HNN GUI window, click:</p>
<pre><code>View &gt; View Simulation Dipoles</code></pre>
<p>This will allow the user to view the dipole signal contributions from individual layers. The following window will appear (first reload the ERPYes2Trials.param simulation, that was run above, into HNN).</p>
<div class="stylefig">
<h3 id="figure-10">Figure 10</h3>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image14.png"><img class="imgcenter100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image14.png" alt="image14" style="max-width:500px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<p>This window shows the dipole contributions from Layer 2/3 (top), Layer 5 (middle), and the aggregate (bottom). Note the different features in Layer 2/3 vs Layer 5 dipole signals, allowing you to tease apart how the different cortical layers contribute to different net waveform features. In this figure, the gray traces are from individual trials (n=2), and the white trace is the average across trials. The same dipole scaling factor is applied (3000.0).</p>
<p>The bottom drop-down menu, which currently has “Show All Trials” selected, allows you to change the view to show the dipole signals from an individual trial. You can also save the image using the standard matplotlib menu at the top (see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://matplotlib.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1552418807697000">https://matplotlib.org/</a> for more information).</p>
<h3 id="viewing-network-spiking-activity">4.2 Viewing network spiking activity</h3>
<p>To view the spiking activity generated by different neuronal populations in the network, navigate to the main GUI window and select:</p>
<pre><code>View &gt; View Simulation Spiking Activity</code></pre>
<p>The following window will appear.</p>
<div class="stylefig">
<h3 id="figure-11">Figure 11</h3>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image12.png"><img class="imgcenter100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image12.png" alt="image12" style="max-width:500px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<p>This window shows the spiking activity produced in each population in response to the evoked inputs. The top two panels show histograms of distal evoked inputs (green) and proximal evoked inputs (red) provided to the neurons. The large third panel shows a raster plot of the spiking activity generated by the individual neurons, with different populations in different colors as labeled (x-axis: time in ms; y-axis: neuron identifier). The neuron identifiers are arranged vertically by layer, with top representing supragranular layers and the bottom representing the infragranular layers. Individual neuron types are drawn in the different colors shown in the legend. The dotted lines in the bottom panel show a time-series of summed activity per population (these use the same color code as the individual spikes; you can turn these lines off or on by selecting View&gt; Toggle Histograms). The initial view shows the aggregate spiking activity across trials. To see spiking activity generated by a single trial, select the trial number using the combination box at the bottom of the window. This spike viewer window also provides the standard save/navigation functionality through the matplotlib control at the top.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-erp-spectrograms">4.3 Viewing ERP Spectrograms</h3>
<p>HNN allows you to generate a time-frequency representation of ERP dipole signals. In order to do so, access the Run parameters by navigating to the main GUI window and selecting:</p>
<pre><code>Set Parameters &gt; Run</code></pre>
<p>Then, click on the Analysis tab of the Run window and change the value for ‘Save spectral data’ from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>Running an ERP simulation will now display the wavelet time-frequency representation of the ERP dipole signal as shown in the figure below. Note that when running multiple trials, the average of individual wavelet transforms is shown, rather than performing the wavelet transform on the average dipole signal. Also note that in the simulation below, the evoked inputs were shifted forward 50 ms in time, because the wavelet analysis cuts off the first 50 ms of the dipole signal to avoid edge artifacts. Finally, note that the previous simulation was removed before running this new simulation.</p>
<div class="stylefig">
<h3 id="figure-12">Figure 12</h3>

<p><a id="toc_5"></a></p>
<h2 id="comparing-model-output-and-recorded-data">5. Comparing model output and recorded data</h2>
<p>When data are loaded into HNN and a simulation is run, the software automatically calculates and plots root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) between the average simulation ERP waveform and the waveform loaded. An example of this is shown in the figure below for the two trial simulation described in Step 4.</p>
<p>To create this figure, follow Step 1 to load the yes_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg.txt data file.</p>
<pre><code>File &gt; Load data file &gt; data/MEG_detection_data/yes_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg.txt</code></pre>
<p>HNN will load the data and display the waveform in the dipole window as shown with a blue dotted line below. (Note: data not collected at 600 Hz must first be downsampled to 600 Hz to be viewed in the HNN GUI).</p>
<div class="stylefig">
<h3 id="figure-13">Figure 13</h3>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image10.png"><img class="imgcenter100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image10.png" alt="image10" style="max-width:500px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<p>HNN will also calculate the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) between the average simulation simulated ERP waveform (black trace, n = 2 trials ) and the waveform loaded from the .txt file. As seen in the figure, the RMSE = 5.37 in this case. Notice that when we simulated more trials (n = 100), as shown in the figure in Step 3, the RMSE between the data and the simulated average ERP was slightly higher (RMSE = 5.57). Depending on the number of trials you run, and adjustments to the parameter values, you may be able to reduce the RMSE.</p>
<p><a id="toc_6"></a></p>
<h2 id="adjusting-parameters">6. Adjusting parameters</h2>
<p>Parameter adjustments will be key to developing and testing hypotheses on the circuit origin of your own ERP data. HNN is designed so that many of parameters in the model can be adjusted from the GUI (see Tour of the GUI). Here, we’ll walk through examples of how to adjust several “Evoked Input” parameters to investigate how they impact the evoked response.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-synchrony-of-the-evoked-inputs">6.1 Changing the synchrony of the evoked inputs</h3>
<p>In the example evoked response simulation described in Step 3, the time that each exogenous driving spike was provided to each cell in the local network was chosen independently from a Gaussian distribution, for both the proximal and distal inputs; this variability in timing created variability in the response of each cell in the network. Asynchronous exogenous drive is the default configuration in HNN. HNN also provides the capability to provide exogenous driving inputs to all cells in the network synchronously (0ms lag); this will reduce variability in timing of evoked inputs, producing a stronger response, and may or may not provide a better fit to the data.</p>
<p>To change the evoked inputs to contact the cells in network synchronously, first change the simulation name to, e.g., ERPYes2TrialsSync in the main Set Parameters window. This will save the simulation data to a file with this new name. If you don’t still have the “Evoked Inputs” dialog window open, click:</p>
<pre><code>Set Parameters &gt; Evoked Inputs</code></pre>
<p>Click the “Synchronous Inputs”checkbox, then press the Start Simulation button in the main HNN GUI.</p>

<p>After the simulation has completed, you’ll see the following output. Although the model replicates some gross features of the experimental data, the fit to the data is now substantially worse (RMSE = 16.25). Notice also that there is significantly lower variability of the input times in the green/red histograms at the top of the figure (compare to evoked response inputs shown in Step 5), predicting (in this case) the evoked responses are more likely to be non-synchronous. Remember, however, that this simulation is only based on two trials.</p>

<p>If you’re adventurous and have some time, try running the same parameters with 100 trials. Doing so will reduce the RMSE as shown in the image below (RMSE = 13.92). Notice also the change in the histograms of driving spikes.</p>

<h3 id="changing-the-timing-and-strength-post-synaptic-conductance-of-the-evoked-inputs">6.2 Changing the timing and strength (post-synaptic conductance) of the evoked inputs</h3>
<p>For this part of the tutorial, we’ll load a different experimental data set into the GUI, at first keeping the simulated data from step 6.1. The new experimental data represents the evoked response from non-detected threshold level stimuli in the experiment described in the “Getting Started” section above [1].</p>
<p>First, let’s clear the MEG data from the detectedthreshold level stimuli. To do this, navigate to the main GUI window and click:</p>
<pre><code> File &gt; Clear data file</code></pre>
<p>You can also clear the data file by clicking Control-C.</p>
<p>Next, load the data from the non-detectedtrial.</p>
<pre><code>File &gt; Load data file &gt; data/MEG_detection_data/no_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg.txt</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the timing and magnitude of the peaks in this new data set (the purple dashed curve in the below figure) are different than for the evoked responses that were detected (shown in red curve in Step 6.1).</p>
<p>HNN will automatically recalculate the model fit to the data (i.e, the RMSE between the average model response and the loaded data) based on the prior simulations (Step 6.1), showing that the previously used parameter set gave a poor fit to the new data (RMSE = 22.73).</p>
<div class="stylefig">
<h3 id="figure-17">Figure 17</h3>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image21.png"><img class="imgcenter100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/erp/images/image21.png" alt="image21" style="max-width:500px;"/></a></p>
</div>
<p>In this case, the magnitudes of the peaks in the model are larger than the data, and the timing of the peaks is faster.</p>
<p>Hypothesis testing: Logical hypotheses to test to account for these differences would be (1) a decrease in the strength of the inputs that create the evoked response, and (2) delaying the arrival time of these inputs to the network. The former hypothesis is likely to decrease the magnitude of the peaks, and the latter to delay their timing, hence creating a better fit to the data.</p>
<p>To test these hypotheses, we’ll adjust the parameters as described. For simplicity, we have created a param file, which can be loaded into the GUI, that accounts for such changes and accurately reproduces the new data. Load the ERPNo100Trials.paramfile values by clicking Set Parameters From File and selecting the file from HNN’s param subfolder or your local machine. To view the new parameters, click:</p>

<p>Notice that the weights (post-synaptic conductances) of the evoked inputs to pyramidal neurons, relative to interneurons in a given layer, are generally smaller than they were in the simulations in Step 6.1 and in prior steps. Also, the mean input times are greater for all inputs, and the variances has increased for the Proximal 2 input.</p>
<p>To run the simulation, let’s reduce the number of trials to 2 (in the “Run” dialog box, see Step 4 above) for speed, change the simulation name (in the “Set Parameters” dialog box), and see how well the data fits after running the simulation (with the Start Simulation button on the main GUI).</p>
<p>Simulation results after running 2 trials in the model with the new parameters (non-detection parameters) are shown in the figure below.</p>

</div>
<p>For this new parameter set, there is now a better fit to the experimental data (RMSE = 6.86). One interpretation of these results is that on non-detected trials (data are in Step 6.2), the feedback (distal 1) and late-feedforward (proximal 2) inputs to the network are more delayed, less synchronous, and overall weaker than on detected trials (see Step 6.1 and above).</p>
<h3 id="simulating-the-suprathreshold-response">6.2.1 Simulating the Suprathreshold response</h3>
<p>For this part of the tutorial, we’ll load a different experimental data set into the GUI, at first keeping the simulated data from step 6.1. The new experimental data represents the evoked response from suprathreshold level stimuli in the experiment described in the “Getting Started” section above [1].</p>
<p>First, let’s clear any MEG and simulation data currently loaded. To do this, navigate to the main GUI window and click:</p>
<pre><code>Edit &gt; Clear canvas</code></pre>
<p>You can also clear the canvas by clicking Control-X</p>
<p>Now that the canvas has been cleared, load the data from the threshold-level detectedtrials and the data from the new suprathreshold-level detected trials.</p>

</div>
<p>Next, load the threshold-level parameters into HNN. At the top of the HNN GUI, click Set Parameters From File and select the file default.param from HNN’s param subfolder from your local machine.</p>

</div>
<p>HNN will automatically calculate the model fit to both datasets loaded (i.e, the RMSE between the average model response and the loaded data) based on the default simulation, showing that the threshold level parameter set (default.param) gives a poor fit to the new data (Dark blue trace with RMSE = 33.01).</p>
<p>Hypothesis testing: Logical hypotheses to test to account for these differences would be (1) an increase in the strength of the inputs that create the evoked response, and (2) reducing the delay in the arrival time of the inputs to the network. The former hypothesis is likely to increase the magnitude of the peaks, and the latter to cause them to occur earlier, creating a better fit to the data.</p>
<p>To test these hypotheses, we’ll adjust the parameters as described. For simplicity, we have created a param file, which can be loaded into the GUI, that accounts for such changes and accurately reproduces the new data.

<p>Next, let’s run the simulation with the Start Simulation button on the main GUI.</p>
<p>Simulation results after running the model with the new parameters (supra-threshold detection parameters) are shown in the figure below.</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s take a look at the output. First, note that the previous threshold-level simulation was not removed (dipole drawn with dotted black line), to allow comparison to the new supra-threshold simulation (dipole drawn with solid black line). For the new suprathreshold detection parameter set, there is now a better fit to the experimental data (RMSE = 16.58), with all major waveform features in the experiment and simulation in agreement. One interpretation of these results is that on supra-threshold detected trials, both the feedforward and feedback inputs stronger and both early and late feedforward inputs arrive substantially earlier. Overall stronger inputs, then promotes tactile detection.</p>
