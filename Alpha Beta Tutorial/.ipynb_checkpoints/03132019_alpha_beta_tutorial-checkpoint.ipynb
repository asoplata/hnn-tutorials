    "<span class=\"c7\">We found that a sequence of exogenous subthreshold excitatory synaptic drive could activate the network in a manner that reproduced important features of the SI rhythms in the model (</span><span class=\"c19\">Figure 2</span><span class=\"c7\">). This drive consisted of two nearly-synchronous 10 Hz rhythmic drives that contacted the network through proximal and distal projection pathways (</span><span class=\"c19\">Figure 3</span><span class=\"c7\">). The drives were simulated as population “bursts” of action potentials that contacted the network every 100 ms with the mean delay between the proximal and distal burst of 0ms. Specifically, as shown schematically in</span> <span class=\"c19\">Figure 3</span><span class=\"c7\">, the population bursts consisted of 10, 2-spike bursts, Gaussian distributed in time. We presumed that during such spontaneous activity, these drives may be provided by leminscial and non-lemniscal thalamic nuclei, which contact proximal and distal pyramidal neurons respectively, and are know to burst fire at  ~10 Hz frequencies in spontaneous states</span><span class=\"c7 c36 c18\">[5,6](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://paperpile.com/c/XBRvEX/CgPQ%2BoQZB&sa=D&ust=1552525363601000)</span><span class=\"c0\">.</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c7\">We assumed that the macroscale rhythms generating the observed alpha and beta activity arrose from subthreshold current flow in a large population of neurons, as opposed to being generated by local spiking interaction. As such, the effective strengths of the exogenous driving inputs were tuned so that the cells in the network remained subthreshold (all other parameters were tuned and fixed base on the morphology, physiology and connectivity within layered neocortical circuits, see Jones et al. 2009</span><span class=\"c7 c36 c18\">[1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://paperpile.com/c/XBRvEX/NxR0&sa=D&ust=1552525363601000)</span><span class=\"c7\">for details). The inputs drove subthreshold currents up and down the pyramidal neurons to reproduce accurate waveform and spectrogram features (see</span> <span class=\"c19\">Figure</span><span class=\"c7\"> </span><span class=\"c19\">3</span><span class=\"c0\">). A scaling factor of 3000 was multiplied by the model waveform to reproduce nAm units comparable to the recorded data, suggesting on the order 200 x 3000 = 600,000 pyramidal neurons contributed to this signal.         </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c7\">We further found that decreasing the delay between the drives to ~50 ms created a pure alpha oscillations, while with an ~0 ms delay beta events emerged and increasing the strength of the distal drive created a stronger beta activity (data not shown; see parameter exploration below). This result led to the novel prediction that brief beta events emerge from a broad proximal drive disrupted by a simultaneous strong distal drive that lasted 50 ms (i.e., one beta period). Support for this prediction was found invasively with laminar recordings in mice and monkeys</span><span class=\"c7 c36 c18\">[3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://paperpile.com/c/XBRvEX/ciWL&sa=D&ust=1552525363602000)</span><span class=\"c0\">.</span>\n",

We will walk you step-by-step through simulations with various combinations of rhythmic proximal and distal drives to describe how each contributes to the alpha and beta components of the SI alpha/beta complex rhythm. We will begin by simulating only rhythmic proximal alpha frequency inputs (Step 1), followed by distal only alpha frequency inputs (Step 2), followed by various combinations of proximal and distal drive to generate alpha and beta rhythms.

For further details on the connectivity structure of the network, see the</span> <span class=\"c7 c15\">Under the Hood</span><span class=\"c7\">section of the HNN website. Rhythmic proximal input occurs through stochastic, presynaptic bursts of action potentials from a population of bursting cells (set with “Number bursts”; see</span> <span class=\"c19\">Figure 3</span><span class=\"c7\">) onto postsynaptic neurons of the modelled network. Stochasticity is introduced in two places: the spike train start time for each bursting cell is sampled from a normal distribution with mean “Start time mean (ms)” and standard deviation “Start time stdev (ms)” and the inter-burst intervals for each bursting cell are sampled from a normal distribution of mean</span> ![](images/image1.png)<span class=\"c7\">(e.g., a 100 ms inter-burst interval corresponds to a “Burst frequency” of 10 Hz) and standard deviation “Burst stdev (ms)” (see</span> <span class=\"c19\">Figure 3</span><span class=\"c0\">). Also note that the number of spikes per burst unit is set with “Spikes/burst” (currently, only values of 1 and 2 with a fixed 10ms delay can be used) and the final stop time for the entire population of rhythmic proximal inputs is set with “Stop time (ms)”.</span>\n",

There are AMPA and NMDA receptors on each cell type (pyramidal and basket cells). There is also a delay parameter to control the arrival time of each spike to the network. In this example, the delay to the layer 2/3 cells is 0.1 ms, with a slightly longer delay to the layer 5 cells of 1 ms.

    "<span class=\"c0\">As shown in the red histogram in the top panel of the HNN GUI above, with this parameter set, a burst of proximal input spikes is provided to the network ~10 Hz (i.e., every 100 ms). Due to the stochastic nature of the inputs (controlled by the start time stdev and Burst stdev parameters, there is some variability in the histogram of proximal input times. Note that a decrease in the Burst stdev would create shorter duration bursts (i.e., more synchronous bursts); this will be explored further in step 6.1 below.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c7\">The ~10 Hz bursts of proximal drive induces current flow up the pyramidal neuron dendrites increasing the signal above the 0 nAm baseline, which then relaxes back to zero, approximately every 100 ms. This is observed in the black current dipole waveform in the GUI window. The middle panel shows the corresponding time-frequency spectrogram for this waveform that exhibits a high-power continuous 10 Hz signal. Importantly, in this example the strength of the proximal input was titrated to be subthreshold (i.e., cells do not spike) under the assumption that macroscale oscillations are generated primarily by subthreshold current flow across large populations of synchronous pyramidal neurons. In step</span> <span class=\"c7\">6.2</span><span class=\"c0\"> below, we explore differences in the signal when the cells are driven to spike (see also ERP tutorial).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c7\">While this exploration with proximal drive is only useful in understanding how subthreshold rhythmic inputs impact the current dipole produced by the circuit, several features of the waveform and spectrogram of the signal do not match the recorded data shown in</span> <span class=\"c19\">Figures 1</span><span class=\"c7\">and</span> <span class=\"c19\">2</span><span class=\"c0\">.

Due to the stochastic nature of the inputs (controlled by the start time stdev, and Burst stdev parameters), there is some variability in the histogram of proximal input times. The ~10 Hz bursts of distal input induces current flow down the pyramidal neuron dendrites decreasing the signal below the 0 nAm baseline, which then relaxes back to zero, approximately every 100 ms. This is observed in the black current dipole waveform in the GUI window. The middle panel shows the corresponding time-frequency spectrogram for this waveform that exhibits a high power continuous 10 Hz signal. Importantly, in this example the strength of the distal input was also titrated to be subthreshold (i.e., cells do not spike) under the assumption that macroscale oscillations are generated primarily by subthreshold current flow across large populations of synchronous pyramidal neurons.  </span>\n",

Due to the stochastic nature of the inputs, there is some variability in the timing and duration of the input bursts such that sometimes they arrive at the same time and sometimes there is a slight offset between them. As a result, intermittent transient alpha and beta  events emerge in the time-frequency spectrogram. Alpha events are produced when the inputs occur slightly</span> <span class=\"c7 c15\">out of phase</span> <span class=\"c7\">and current flow is pushed alternately up and down the dendrites for ~50 ms duration each (set by the length of the bursts inputs). B</span><span class=\"c7\">eta events occur when the burst inputs arrive more synchronously and the upward current flow is disrupted by downward current flow for ~50 ms to effectively cut the oscillation period in half. As such, the relative alpha to beta expression can be controlled by the delay between the inputs and their relative burst strengths.

This is due to the fact that the spontaneous SI signal we are simulating is not time locked to  alpha or beta events on any given trial, and the stochastic nature of the driving inputs causes variability in the timing of the alpha or beta activity, making it difficult to align recorded data and simulated results. However, a direct comparison can be made between time averaged recorded and simulated signals by comparing power spectral density waveforms. An example of comparison is shown in step 5 below.</span>\n",

Each tutorial step up to this point was based on simulating un-averaged data. Here, we describe how to run and average multiple “trials” (700 ms epochs of spontaneous activity). We show that, due to the stochastic nature of the proximal and distal rhythmic input, controlled by the standard deviation (stdev) of the start times, and the stdev of the input bursts), when running multiple trials, the precise timing of the input bursts on each trial is jittered, and hence the alpha and beta activity in the spectrograms on each trial is jittered. This is akin to simulating induced rhythms rather than time-locked evoked rhythms. In the averaged spectrogram across trials, the alpha and beta events accumulate without cancellation (due to the fact that spectrogram value are purely positive) creating the impression of a continuous oscillation (</span><span class=\"c19\">Figure 1</span><span class=\"c0\">, left panel).</span>\n",

Approximately 10 Hz rhythmicity in the timing of the distal and proximal inputs can be clearly visualized (note also the symmetric profile of the histograms).

This rhythmic alteration of proximal followed by distal drive induces alternating subthreshold current flow up and down the pyramidal neuron dendrites to create a continuous alpha oscillation in the current dipole waveform that oscillates around 0 nAm. The period of the oscillation is set by the duration of each burst (~50 ms, controlled in part by Burst stdev) and the 50 ms delay between the inputs on each cycle (due to different start times). The corresponding spectrogram shows continuous nearly pure alpha activity. This type of strong alpha activity is similar to what might be observed over occipital cortex during eyes closed conditions.</span>\n",
